# Kiran Kumar Gaddi — Cybersecurity Portfolio

> Hands-on projects in **SOC/Blue Team**, **Cloud Security (AWS/Azure)**, **GRC**, and **AI Security**.  
> Built to demonstrate practical skills beyond certifications (Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate; ISC2 CC prep).

## 🔎 What you'll find
- **SOC Detection Lab** — Splunk & Microsoft Sentinel detections, KQL/SPL queries, incident write-ups.
- **AWS Cloud Security Lab** — IAM, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, WAF demos with IaC where possible.
- **Vulnerability Management** — Nessus Essentials/Qualys scans, triage & remediation tracking.
- **GRC Policy Pack** — NIST CSF / 800-53 mappings, risk register, policies & procedures.
- **AI Security Demos** — LLM prompt-injection detection, model/pipe hardening notes using MITRE ATLAS.

## ✅ Hiring Manager Highlights
- Real **detections** (logs → query → alert → response).
- Cloud **security controls** configured with screenshots and reproducible steps.
- **Risk register** and policy samples aligned to NIST functions.
- **Before/After** evidence for vulnerabilities with remediation proof.
- Short **postmortems** using the same structure every time.

## 🧰 Tech Used
Splunk · Microsoft Sentinel (KQL) · ELK · AWS IAM/CloudTrail/GuardDuty/Security Hub/WAF · Azure Entra ID & Defender · Nessus/Qualys · Python · Bash · MITRE ATT&CK/ATLAS · NIST CSF & 800-53

## 🧭 How to Navigate
Each folder has a README with:
- **Objective** (what skill is demonstrated)
- **Environment** (how to reproduce the lab)
- **Steps** (commands, queries, screenshots)
- **Findings** (what was detected/fixed)
- **Artifacts** (scripts, dashboards, exports)
- **Lessons learned** (1–3 bullets)
